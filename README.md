## **Introduction**

Welcome to FreshNow store, an e-commerce site was built to fill the requirements of the final project part of my studies on Web Developer Application Diploma. 
This is a fully responsive website, developed by utilising the principles of UX design and using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Python, Django technologies as well as  SQL database through Heroku PostgreSQL and Stripe online test payments.
FreshNow is a full-stack site based around a business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset and accepts purchases via Stripe test card details. For further details on cards numbers click [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
